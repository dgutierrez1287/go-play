A web HTML5 interface for experimenting with Go code.

The Go back-end service can format, compile, link, and run Go programs
and return the results. A HTML5-compliant brower is used for editing
displaying output and errors.

It is similar to the Go Playground: http://golang.org/doc/play/ but it
is less restricted -- for better or worse. This means

- You can use locally install go and other packages.
- the date and time are those set on the server
- You can run long computations
- No Internet access is needed.
- Data can be totally private
